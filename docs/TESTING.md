## End-to-End Test Scenarios

### Test Scenario 1: Simple Web App (Happy Path)

**Goal**: Test full autopilot workflow from requirement to PR

**Steps**:
1. Start autopilot: `/autopilot "Build a simple TODO app with user authentication"`
2. Phase 1: Answer clarification questions (A, B, C, D)
3. Phase 2: Approve task breakdown
4. Phase 3: Watch autonomous implementation (35+ tasks)
5. Phase 4: Observe auto-healing when errors occur
6. Phase 5: Verify quality gates and PR creation

**Expected Results**:
- PRD generated in `.autopilot/prd.md`
- Tasks created in `.autopilot/tasks/{module}/{task}.md`
- All tasks implemented with tests
- Auto-healing fixes common errors (missing deps, type errors)
- Quality gates pass (typecheck, lint, tests, build)
- Commit created with co-author
- PR created (if gh CLI available)

**Success Criteria**:
- All 5 phases complete
- >90% tasks passing
- <10% tasks failed (marked as failed, not blocking)
- PR ready for human review

### Test Scenario 2: Multi-Language Project (Language Detection)

**Goal**: Test AI language detection for non-TypeScript projects

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to a Python/Go/Rust project
2. Run: `/detect-language`
3. Verify detected language, framework, and verify commands
4. Start autopilot in detected language context

**Expected Results**:
- Correct language detected (Python, Go, Rust, etc.)
- Appropriate framework identified (Django, Flask, FastAPI for Python)
- Verify commands matched to language (pytest, go test, cargo test)

**Success Criteria**:
- Detection works for at least 5 different languages
- Framework detection accurate
- Verify commands executable

### Test Scenario 3: Error Recovery (Auto-Healing)

**Goal**: Test Phase 4 auto-healing with intentional errors

**Setup**:
1. Modify a task to require non-existent dependency
2. Run implementation

**Expected Results**:
- Phase 3 detects error: "Module 'foo' not found"
- Phase 4 invoked automatically
- WebSearch finds solution: "npm install foo"
- Fix applied: dependency installed
- Tests re-run: passing
- Task marked as completed (healed)

**Success Criteria**:
- Healing completes within 3 attempts
- Dependency correctly installed
- Tests pass after healing
- Task status: passing (healed)

### Test Scenario 4: Quality Gates Failure

**Goal**: Test Phase 5 blocking on quality gate failures

**Setup**:
1. Introduce type error in implementation
2. Complete all tasks in Phase 3
3. Proceed to Phase 5

**Expected Results**:
- Type checking fails
- Phase 5 blocks delivery
- Error message shows type errors
- No commit created
- No PR created

**Success Criteria**:
- Delivery blocked until errors fixed
- Clear error messages shown
- Process can resume after fixing errors

### Test Scenario 5: Two-Stage Code Review

**Goal**: Test Phase 5's spec compliance and code quality checks

**Expected Results**:
- Stage 1: All acceptance criteria verified
- Stage 2: Code quality suggestions shown (if any)
- Both stages complete successfully
- Review results included in PR description

**Success Criteria**:
- Spec compliance: all criteria met
- Code quality: suggestions shown but non-blocking
- Review results documented

## Manual Verification Checklist

---

## Known Limitations (Not Bugs, by Design)

1. **CLI create command not implemented** - Phase 2 creates task files manually using bash/markdown
2. **WebSearch results simulated** - Skills show structure, actual WebSearch uses tool
3. **Agent spawning conceptual** - Skills describe Task tool usage but don't call it directly in bash
4. **Language-specific commands** - Some languages may need custom verify commands
5. **PR creation requires gh CLI** - Falls back to manual instructions if not installed

---

## Performance Expectations

Based on internal design:

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Task completion rate | >90% | With auto-healing |
| Auto-heal success rate | >80% | For common errors |
| Time savings vs manual | >50% | Compared to hand-coding |
| Test coverage | >80% | TDD enforced |
| PR pass rate | >70% | After two-stage review |
