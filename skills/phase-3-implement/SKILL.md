# Phase 3: Implementation Loop

## Overview | 概述

Autonomously implement all tasks using TDD workflow, spawning fresh agents for each task, with automatic error recovery through Phase 4 healing.

使用 TDD 工作流自主实现所有任务，为每个任务生成新的 agent，通过 Phase 4 自愈进行自动错误恢复。

## When to Use | 何时使用

Invoked by autopilot-orchestrator as Phase 3, after Phase 2 (Breakdown) completes and user approves task plan.

## Input | 输入

- Tasks directory: `.autopilot/tasks/`
- Task index: `.autopilot/tasks/index.json`
- Language config from index metadata

## Execution | 执行

### Step 1: Initialize Implementation Loop

**CRITICAL: Verify total task count BEFORE starting loop.**

```bash
# Get total task count from index
TOTAL_TASKS=$(autopilot-cli tasks list --json | jq 'length')

echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "🚀 Starting implementation of $TOTAL_TASKS tasks..."
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo ""

# Verify tasks exist
if [ "$TOTAL_TASKS" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ ERROR: No tasks found in index!"
  echo "   Run Phase 2 (breakdown) first."
  exit 1
fi

# Initialize counters
COMPLETED_COUNT=0
FAILED_COUNT=0
HEALED_COUNT=0
LOOP_ITERATIONS=0
MAX_ITERATIONS=$((TOTAL_TASKS * 2))  # Safety: prevent infinite loops
```

### Step 2: Implementation Loop with Robust Verification

**CRITICAL: This loop MUST NOT exit until ALL tasks are accounted for.**

```bash
while true; do
  LOOP_ITERATIONS=$((LOOP_ITERATIONS + 1))

  # Safety check: prevent infinite loops
  if [ $LOOP_ITERATIONS -gt $MAX_ITERATIONS ]; then
    echo "❌ CRITICAL ERROR: Loop exceeded $MAX_ITERATIONS iterations!"
    echo "   Expected $TOTAL_TASKS tasks, but processed $LOOP_ITERATIONS times."
    echo "   This indicates a bug in task management. Aborting."
    exit 1
  fi

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

1. **Loop MUST NOT exit** until `completed + failed == total tasks`
2. **Verification is mandatory** before breaking loop
3. **If tasks are stuck** in pending/in_progress, loop will error (not silently fail)
4. **Infinite loop protection** prevents runaway execution
5. **Each task MUST use Task tool** to spawn subagent (see Step 3)

### Step 3: Implement Single Task

**For EACH task, you MUST spawn a fresh implementer agent using the Task tool.**

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT implement tasks yourself in the main session. ALWAYS use Task tool to spawn subagents.

**Implementation Flow:**

1. **Get task details from CLI:**
   ```bash
   TASK_JSON=$(autopilot-cli tasks next --json)
   TASK_ID=$(echo "$TASK_JSON" | jq -r '.id')
   ```

2. **Build implementer prompt:**
   Read the full task file content and create a comprehensive prompt that includes:
   - Task ID, description, module
   - Full acceptance criteria
   - Test requirements and patterns
   - Dependencies
   - TDD workflow instructions (see template below)

3. **Spawn fresh implementer subagent using Task tool:**

   **MANDATORY: Use the Task tool with these parameters:**

   ```
   Tool: Task
   Parameters:
     subagent_type: "general-purpose"
     description: "Implement task: {task.id}"
     prompt: "{full_implementer_prompt_from_template_below}"
     run_in_background: false  (blocking - wait for completion)
   ```

   **DO NOT skip this step. DO NOT implement in main session.**

4. **Wait for subagent to complete:**
   - The subagent will follow TDD workflow
   - Write tests first (RED phase)
   - Implement code (GREEN phase)
   - Refactor (REFACTOR phase)
   - Verify all tests pass
   - Report results

5. **Check subagent result:**
   - If successful → Mark task as done using CLI
   - If failed → Invoke Phase 4 (heal) for auto-recovery
   - Update progress and continue to next task

**Implementer Agent Prompt Template:**

Use this exact template when spawning implementer agents:

```markdown
You are an autonomous implementer agent for a single task in an autopilot workflow.

## TASK INFORMATION

**Task ID:** {task.id}
**Module:** {task.module}
**Priority:** P{task.priority}
**Estimated:** {task.estimatedMinutes} minutes

**Description:**
{task.description}

**Acceptance Criteria:**
{list each criterion with checkboxes}
- [ ] {criterion 1}
- [ ] {criterion 2}
...

**Dependencies:** {list or "None"}
**Test Pattern:** {task.testRequirements.unit.pattern}
**Test Required:** {task.testRequirements.unit.required}

---

## TDD IRON LAW (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

**If you wrote code before the test → DELETE it completely. Start over.**

This is non-negotiable. No "reference", no "adaptation", no "keeping it".
DELETE means DELETE.

## WORKFLOW (TDD)

### 1. RED Phase - Write Failing Tests

- Create test file: {test_pattern}
- Write ONE minimal test for FIRST acceptance criterion
- Run test → MUST show failure (not error, actual test failure)
- Verify failure message is expected (feature missing, not typo)
- **If test passes immediately → You're testing existing code, fix the test**
- **If test errors → Fix error first, then verify it fails correctly**

### 2. GREEN Phase - Implement Minimum Code

- Write SMALLEST amount of code to pass the ONE test
- No extra features beyond what the test requires
- No premature optimization
- No refactoring of other code
- Run tests → they MUST pass
- **If test still fails → Fix code, NOT test**

### 3. REFACTOR Phase - Clean Code (ONLY after GREEN)

- Improve naming, structure
- Remove duplication
- Apply design patterns if appropriate
- Run tests after EACH change → must stay passing
- **If tests fail during refactor → Revert change immediately**

### 4. REPEAT - Next Test

- Go back to RED for next acceptance criterion
- One test at a time, one feature at a time
- Complete RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for each

### 5. VERIFY - Final Check

Before marking complete, verify:
- [ ] All tests pass ✓
- [ ] Coverage >80% ✓
- [ ] All acceptance criteria satisfied ✓
- [ ] No linting errors ✓
- [ ] Output pristine (no warnings, no console.log) ✓

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)

Before marking task complete, verify EVERY item:

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail BEFORE implementing (saw RED)
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason (feature missing, not typo)
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test (no over-engineering)
- [ ] All tests pass (run full test suite)
- [ ] No test was written after the code (all tests-first)
- [ ] Tests use real code, not mocks (unless unavoidable)
- [ ] Edge cases and errors covered
- [ ] No production code exists without a corresponding test

**Cannot check all boxes? → Start over with TDD. No exceptions.**

## RED FLAGS - STOP IMMEDIATELY

If you catch yourself:
- Writing code before test
- Test passes on first run (didn't see it fail)
- Adding multiple tests before any implementation
- Implementing features not required by current test
- "I'll add tests after to verify it works"
- "This is too simple to test"
- "I already manually tested it"
- Keeping code written before tests "as reference"

**ALL of these mean: DELETE CODE. Start over with TDD.**

## CONSTRAINTS

- Only implement what's specified in acceptance criteria
- Follow TDD Iron Law strictly (tests ALWAYS first, no exceptions)
- Use project's language/framework conventions
- Keep code clean and simple
- One test → One minimal implementation → Refactor → Repeat

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

When done, report:
1. **Files created/modified** (list all)
2. **Test results** (X/Y tests passed, Z% coverage)
3. **Duration** (actual time spent)
4. **Issues encountered** (if any)
5. **All acceptance criteria met** (confirm with checkboxes)

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT exit until ALL acceptance criteria are satisfied and ALL tests pass.

Start with RED phase now.
```

### Step 4: Invoke Healing (When Implementer Fails)

**When a task implementation fails, invoke Phase 4 (Heal) for automatic error recovery.**

**Auto-Healing Flow:**

1. **Capture error details:**
   - Extract error message from implementer agent output
   - Identify error type (dependency missing, syntax error, test failure, etc.)
   - Note which acceptance criteria failed

2. **Invoke phase-4-heal skill:**

   **Use Skill tool to invoke healing:**

   ```
   Tool: Skill
   Parameters:
     skill: "phase-4-heal"
     args: "--task-id {task.id} --error '{error_message}'"
   ```

   The heal skill will:
   - WebSearch for error solution
   - Apply fix automatically
   - Re-run tests
   - Return success/failure

3. **Check healing result:**
   - If healed successfully (tests pass):
     * Mark task as completed
     * Increment auto-healed counter
     * Log to debug.log
     * Continue to next task

   - If healing failed (still errors after 3 attempts):
     * Mark task as failed
     * Log detailed error to debug.log
     * Continue to next task (don't block entire workflow)

4. **Update progress:**
   ```bash
   echo "🔧 Auto-healed: $HEALED_COUNT errors"
   ```

**IMPORTANT:** Auto-healing should be attempted ONCE per task failure. If healing fails, mark task as failed and move on. Do NOT retry indefinitely.

### Step 5: Final Summary

```bash
echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"
echo "🎯 Implementation Complete!"
echo ""
echo "📊 Final Statistics:"
echo "   Total tasks: $TASK_COUNT"
echo "   ✅ Completed: $COMPLETED"
echo "   ❌ Failed: $FAILED"
echo "   🔧 Auto-healed: $HEALED"
echo "   Success rate: $((COMPLETED * 100 / TASK_COUNT))%"
echo ""

if [ $FAILED -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  Some tasks failed. They are marked with status='failed'."
  echo "   Review failed tasks in .autopilot/tasks/"
  echo ""
fi

echo "▶️  Next: Phase 5 (Deliver) - Quality gates and PR creation"
```

### Step 6: Update State

```bash
# Update state to deliver phase
autopilot-cli state update --phase deliver
```

### Step 7: Return Result

```yaml
---PHASE RESULT---
phase: implement
status: complete
completed: {N}
failed: {M}
auto_healed: {K}
success_rate: {X}%
next_phase: deliver
summary: |
  Implemented {N}/{total} tasks successfully.
  Auto-healed {K} errors.
  {M} tasks failed and need manual attention.
  Ready for quality verification and delivery.
---END PHASE RESULT---
```

## Progress Updates | 进度更新

Show progress after each task:

## Error Handling | 错误处理

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| No tasks found | Prompt to run Phase 2 |
| Task implementation fails | Invoke Phase 4 (heal) |
| Healing fails (max 3 attempts) | Mark task as failed, continue |
| All tasks fail | Continue to Phase 5, report failures |
| User interrupts | Save state, allow resume |

## Rules | 规则

1. **Fresh agent per task** - Prevent context pollution
2. **TDD workflow mandatory** - Tests before implementation
3. **Auto-heal on first error** - Try to fix automatically
4. **Mark failed after heal attempts** - Continue to next task
5. **Show progress regularly** - After each task and every 3 tasks
6. **Never skip tasks** - Process in priority order
7. **Save state continuously** - Can resume anytime

## Notes | 注意事项

- Implementation quality depends on clear acceptance criteria
- Fresh agents ensure no context bleed between tasks
- Auto-healing uses Phase 4 (WebSearch-powered)
- Failed tasks can be manually fixed and re-run later
- Progress is persisted in task files and state.json
